# Yatzy

My brother in law (age 17) wanted to play yatzy, however, we did not have access to any dices. 

We therefore descided to code up a simple yatzy/dices GUI, where one can throw one or all dices to simulate the actual game.

The app is made with an edicational purpuse, therefore as few framworks as possible is chosen, leading to the use of simple html div´s and basic styling.
